This repo contains a list of scientific papers that, broadly, study how particular types of visulization are perceived.

It is rendered in an interactive viewer at [visperception.com](http://www.visperception.com/), using [PubViz](https://github.com/fhstp/PubViz).


## Contributing

Any contributions to this list would be welcome: just send a pull request or [email me](mailto:james@jamesscottbrown.com).

In particular, more work is needed in the following areas:

* adding relevant papers from the BELIV (Beyond Time and Error) and [EuroRV3](http://www.eurorvvv.org/) (Reproducibility, Verification, and Validation in Visualization) workshops

* adding papers on currently missing topics (most notably, studies on color are mostly missing)

* providing better keywords

The site is now hosted by GitHub pages, so changes to ``file.bib`` will appear on the site as soon as they are pushed to the ``master`` branch.
